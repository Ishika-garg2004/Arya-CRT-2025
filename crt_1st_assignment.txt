Assignment 1:-  
Q1.How do lists and tuples differ in terms of mutability and performance? When would you choose one over the other? 
Ans.In terms of mutability lists are mutable, meaning we can modify their elements (add, remove, or change values).
Performance:Lists are slower because they require dynamic memory allocation and additional operations for resizing.
Tuples are faster because they are stored in a fixed manner and are more efficient.

When to use List:
When we need to modify the data (add, remove, update elements).
Order can be change and need flexibility in size.
When to use Tuple:
The data is fixed and should not be changed.
Need fo better performance and lower memory usage.
